        <h1>Interactive Copypastas</h1>
        <p class="maindesc">Welcome to the Interactive Copypastas website. What is this website for? Here you can find interactive copypastas for all your needs. Example: You remember that "GNU plus Linux" copypasta? I'd like to interject for a moment, since you will be able to change the copypasta's keywords, for example "GNU plus Bruh". On the copypasta's page you will be able to input the keyword into the textbox, you have probably seen that before on <a href="https://stallman-copypasta.github.io/">https://stallman-copypasta.github.io/</a>, so yeah, just like that. You can sumbit additions or report issues to the <a href="https://github.com/Calamity34/interactive-copypastas">Github repository</a>. Have a good day!</p>
